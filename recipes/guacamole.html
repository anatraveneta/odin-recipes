    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>I’m not one for hyperbole, but this really is the best guacamole recipe.</strong>
        When it comes to crowd-raving guacamole the key is to not get too fancy or try to be too unique. 
        <strong>Guacamole is meant to be easy to make and delicious.</strong> Plain and simple. 
        It’s a blend of a few high quality ingredients with flavors that meld together beautifully.</p>
    <p>After numerous trips to Mexico and working alongside Mexican chefs, 
        I can confirm that this guacamole is the real deal. 
        Fresh, easy and authentic! Just as you’d get in Mexico.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Avocados:</strong> I’ve got a few tips for picking ripe ones below.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion: </strong>I’m using yellow onion which is most often used in Mexico, 
            but you could use red onion as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes: </strong>Choose Roma tomatoes which are less juicy. No one wants a watery guac.</li>
        <li><strong>Cilantro: </strong>One of my favorite herbs and a staple in Mexican cuisine.</li>
        <li><strong>Jalapeño: </strong>You can also use serrano pepper for a little extra heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>Some people like their guac with garlic, others like it without. 
            I love just a little.</li>
        <li><strong>Lime: </strong>Freshly squeezed is a must. Don’t use jarred lime juice!</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt brings it all together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Slice</strong> three ripe avocados in half.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove </strong>the pit.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop </strong>the avocados into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash </strong>the avocados gently with a fork to your 
            desired level of chunky or smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add </strong>the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeño pepper, garlic, 
            lime juice and salt</li>
        <li><strong>Stir </strong>everything together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That’s it! The most delicious, easy guacamole.</p>
