    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Mediterranean serves as an example to <strong>radiate freshness</strong> from its dishes. 
        In this case we make a Greek version where feta cheese and black olives are not lacking.</p>
    <p>You can flirt with some other fresh and hard cheese or replace the olives with others 
        that you prefer, but this mixture is <strong>a success at any time</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> You'll need four of them, raher riped.</li>
        <li><strong>Cucumnber: </strong>With one it is enough, unles your are a big fan of them!</li>
        <li><strong>Green pepper: </strong>Choose one from your local provider. They're so much tastier!</li>
        <li><strong>Onion: </strong>The red ones add a colourful touch. They're maybe softer also. 
            Challotes are also a good alternative. One piece will be enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Black olives: </strong>Here you can put the amount you want. 
            I personnally love the pickled greek ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Feta cheese: </strong>For four people, 50 gr should be enough. Be sure to get the authentic one!</li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>What could be a Mediterranean salad without it?</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt brings it all together.</li>
        <li><strong>Oregano: </strong>This herb will make the difference!.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cut </strong> the cucumber, the pepper and 
            the tomato into not very small cubes and the onion into medium strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix </strong>everything well in a bowl, with a little salt and 
            a generous splash of olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Add </strong> the olives and finish with the diced feta cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle </strong>a little oregano.</li>
        <li><strong>Squeeze </strong> a little lemon if you want.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And voil√†! A delicious salad to enjoy with family and friends.</p>
